    <h2>What is Pizza?</h2>
    <P>Pizza is a savory dish of Italian origin consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients (such as anchovies, mushrooms, onions, olives, pineapple, meat, etc.), which is then baked at a high temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.</P>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>FOR THE DOUGH</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup warm water (105°F to 115°F)</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons active dry yeast</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon sugar</li>
        <li>2 1/2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FOR THE SAUCE</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 onion, chopped</li>
        <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1 (28-ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon dried basil</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>FOR THE TOPPINGS</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        <li>1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>Your favorite pizza toppings (such as pepperoni, sausage, mushrooms, onions, peppers, etc.)</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>PREPARATION STEPS</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>To make the dough, combine the water, yeast, and sugar in a large bowl. Let stand for 5 minutes, until the yeast is foamy. Stir in the flour, salt, and olive oil until the dough comes together. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-7 minutes, until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise in a warm place for 1 hour, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>While the dough is rising, make the sauce. Heat the olive oil in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Add the onion and garlic and cook until softened, about 5 minutes. Stir in the crushed tomatoes, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook for 15 minutes, or until the sauce has thickened slightly.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 500°F. Punch down the dough and divide it in half. Roll out each half into a 12-inch circle. Place the dough circles on lightly greased baking sheets.</li>
        <li>Spread the sauce evenly over the dough circles. Top with the mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and your favorite pizza toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 10-12 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and the cheese is melted and bubbly. Let cool for a few minutes before slicing and serving.</li>
